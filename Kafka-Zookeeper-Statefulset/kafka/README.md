# Kafka

> Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Its storage layer is essentially a "massively scalable pub/sub message queue designed as a distributed transaction log", making it highly valuable for enterprise infrastructures to process streaming data.
